Below is a YAML file holding simplified information about a subreddit thread. The top level field refer to the information for the thread, such as votes specify how many upvotes. The comments sections hold a list of objects containing information about each comment as well as replies. The reply objects can also have replies, i.e. replies to a reply. 

I want you to summarize the overall subreddit into a paragraph, with more attention given to contents of comments with higher votes. If the content is empty, you can just summarize the comments and give a guess on what is the forum content.
